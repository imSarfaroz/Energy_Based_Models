# Energy_Based_Models
Course Project - COSC 5P77: Probabilistic Graphical Models and Neural Generative Models

The repository contains two main folders: Boltzmann_Machine and Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine.

#Boltzmann_machine
This folder includes the implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine on the MNIST dataset. It also contains versions for both local and cloud-based (.ipynb) execution, ensuring accessibility.

#Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine
This folder includes the implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine on the MNIST dataset. It also contains versions for both local and cloud-based (.ipynb) execution, ensuring accessibility.
